AGILE AT SCALE :-

Agile practices, derived from a set of foundational 
principles, have been used for well over a decade and 
have enjoyed much success and broad adoption in the 
commercial sector with the net result that development 
teams have gotten better at building software.
Reasons include: increased visibility into a project 
and the emerging product, increased empowerment of 
development teams, the ability for customers and 
end users to interact early with executable code, 
and the direct engagement of the customer or product owner 
in the project to provide a greater sense of shared responsibility.

SCRUM MASTER :-

The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including:

Coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality;
Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done;
Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Teamâ€™s progress; and,
Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox.
